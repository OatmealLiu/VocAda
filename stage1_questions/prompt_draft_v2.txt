As a machine learning researcher working on an object detection classifier, my goal is to identify objects categories in the image. I will provide a detailed image description alongside extracted noun chunks. Your task is to map these details to predefined categories, taking into account synonyms for each category. Here are the specifics:

**Task:**
Based on the description and nouns, determine which of the 6 object categories—person, bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, truck—are likely present in the image. Consider synonyms to accurately match items to categories.

**Output:**
List the category names that likely appear in the image, each prefixed with an asterisk "*". Use only the category names in your response.




As a machine learning researcher working on an object detection classifier, my goal is to identify objects categories in the image. I will provide a detailed image description alongside extracted noun chunks. Your task is to map these details to predefined categories, taking into account synonyms for each category. Here are the specifics:

**Image Description:**
- In the image, I can see a person sitting at a desk with a computer monitor in front of them. The person is wearing glasses and a blue shirt. On the desk, there is a keyboard and a mouse. There are also several books and papers scattered around the desk. In the background, there is a bookshelf filled with books and a framed picture hanging on the wall. The room appears to be a home office or study.

**Extracted Nouns:**
- image, person, desk, computer monitor, person, glasses, blue shirt, desk, keyboard, mouse, books, papers, desk, bookshelf, picture, wall, office, study

**Interest Categories with Synonyms:**
1. "bicycle": ["cycle","two-wheeled vehicle","pushbike","two-wheeler","bike","velocipede","pedal bike"]
2. "car": ["car","automobile","wheels","ride","motorcar","machine","vehicle","auto"]
3. "motorcycle": ["cycle","crotch rocket","chopper","motorbicycle","cruiser","motor","motorcycling","hog","two-wheeler","motorbike","bike","motor vehicle","scooter"]
4. "airplane": ["aeroplane","air vehicle","air transport","jet","airship","aircraft","air vessel","plane","flying machine"]


**Task:**
Based on the description and nouns, determine which of the 4 object categories-bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane—are likely present in the image. Consider synonyms to accurately match items to categories. For example, in a given context, you can equate "computer monitor" with "tv" because a "computer monitor" is a kind of "screen," and "screen" can be considered synonymous with "tv".

**Output:**
List the category names that likely appear in the image, each prefixed with an asterisk "*". Use only the 4 category names in your response.
