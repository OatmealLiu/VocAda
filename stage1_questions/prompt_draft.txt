Extracted nouns: ["bicycle", "seat", "rack", "sidewalk", "tree trunk", "white vehicle", "road", "black vehicle", "red buildings", "traffic lights", "leaves"]

And the following is a list of 6 object categories with their synonyms (in the format * object category name : ["synonyms", ..., "synonyms"]) that I am interested in:
* "person": ["someone","personage","being","human being","character","human","somebody","mortal","soul","individual"]
* "bicycle": ["cycle","two-wheeled vehicle","pushbike","two-wheeler","bike","velocipede","pedal bike"]
* "car": ["car","automobile","wheels","ride","motorcar","machine","vehicle","auto"]
* "motorcycle": ["cycle","crotch rocket","chopper","motorbicycle","cruiser","motor","motorcycling","hog","two-wheeler","motorbike","bike","motor vehicle","scooter"]
* "airplane": ["aeroplane","air vehicle","air transport","jet","airship","aircraft","air vessel","plane","flying machine"]
* "truck": ["van","lorry","semi-truck","big rig","cargo truck","trailer","goods carrier","truck","tractor-trailer","eighteen-wheeler","transport","hauler","vehicle","pickup","rig"]

I am a machine learning researcher trying to build an accurate object detection classifier to identify the object categories in the list of 6 object categories that I am interested in from this image. I aim to identify which object categories from my specified list of 6 object categories are likely present in this image, using the information from both the description and the noun chunks extracted from those descriptions. Your job is to analyze the description and the extracted noun chunks, then select which of the object categories from my 6 object categories list are likely present in this image nad its context. Please list the category names you select from the provided list (only list the category names. do not include the synonyms) as being potentially present in this image (separated by bullet points "*").

Note that as long as you think the object represented by the category names or one of the synonyms is present in the image based on the description nad noun chunks, you can select the category.

Be aware that the description may not completely cover all the objects and people present in the image. Thus, in addition to analyzing the description and the extracted noun chunks, please apply your understanding of the context to identify the object categories that might present in the image from the list of object categories that I am interested in. Please list only the selected category names!

Again, I aim to identify which object categories from my specified list of 6 object categories are likely present in this image, using the information from both the description and the noun chunks extracted from those descriptions. Your job is to analyze the description and the extracted noun chunks, then select which of the object categories from my 6 object categories list are likely present in this image nad its context. Please list the category names you select from the provided list (only list the category names. do not include the synonyms) as being potentially present in this image (separated by bullet points "*").
