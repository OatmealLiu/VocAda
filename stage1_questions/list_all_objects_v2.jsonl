{"question_id": 1, "text":"Identify and list every object visible in the image, including those in both the foreground and background. Please categorize the objects into primary (larger or main focus) and secondary (smaller, background, or less noticeable) categories, if applicable. For objects that are part of a group or collection, indicate this by listing them together (e.g., 'a cluster of red apples'). Ambiguous or unclear items should be described with your best guess. Do not describe buildings or text in the image."}
{"question_id": 2, "text":"Carefully examine the provided image and comprehensively list all objects present, including those in both the foreground and background. Please categorize the objects into groups such as 'primary objects' for those that are the main focus, and 'secondary objects' for those in the periphery or background. For each object listed, include any discernible details such as color, size, and apparent material. Highlight any interactions or relationships between objects, like 'a cat sitting on a windowsill,' to provide context. If certain objects are part of a larger group (e.g., a flock of birds, a set of dining utensils), please mention this as well. Aim for completeness and accuracy in your description, capturing the full scene. Do not describe buildings or text in the image."}
